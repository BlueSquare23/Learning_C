This repository contains notes and exercises taken from 'The C Programming
Language' book, as well as notes taken from a freeCodeAcademy video on C, and a
series of exercieses on the w3c's Website.

I have chosen to put it in the public record (on github) for ease of
accessibility to myself and others. A large portion of the content in this
repository is copied from the links below and meant to be used for
demonstrations purposes. The copied works are in the public domain.

The majority of programs written by me can be found within the w3cExercises
directory and the Misc_C_Prog directory. The exceptions to this (i.e. any
copied code) are noted in the comments of the specific programs.
