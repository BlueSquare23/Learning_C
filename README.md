This repository contains notes and exercises taken from 'The C Programming
Language' book, as well as notes taken from a freeCodeAcademy video on C, and a
series of exercieses on the w3c's Website.

I have chosen to put it in the public record (on github) for ease of
accessibility to myself and others. A large portion of the content in this
repository is copied from the links below and meant to be used for
demonstrations purposes. The copied works are in the public domain.

This Repo contains two subdirectories for Notes and Exercises. The Notes dir
contains code examples with explainations. These notes are mainly taken from
"The C Programming Language" and from a freeCodeAcademy youtube course on C
programming. The Exercises directory contains exercise examples from the w3c
and HackerRank as well as some other samples in the Misc dir.
